### <b>INTRODUCTION</b>  

Monty Hall was a game show host and the person this popular problem originates and is named from. The contestant would have **3 doors to choose from**, behind one of them was a car. The problem comes in when Monty opens one of the other 2 doors. Monty, knowing which door has the car, would then obviously open the door without a car. You are then left with the decision of whether to **keep your original answer**, or to **switch to the other remaining door**. Only years later would people realize that there is in fact a decision you should always make.
